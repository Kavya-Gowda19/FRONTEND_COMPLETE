3.Desktop(md):768px - 992px
4.(Optional)Large Desktop(1g):992px

The specific width at which the design changes significantlly is called brakepoints.Your role as a web developer is too implement the layout 
changes at specific breakpoints while ensuring that the page adopts gracefully at all intermediate screen widths.

CSS MEDIA QUERIES
CSS Media Queries are a feature in CSS that let you apply styles only when certain conditions about the device or screen are true.

They are mainly used for responsive design — so your webpage looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
css media queries are a powerful tool that allows you to apply different styles to your web page based on device characteristics 
such as screen size,resolution and orientations.

 syntax
 @media media_type and (condition){
    /*css rules*/
 }
 css rules means the set of CSS properties and values

    ✅ Syntax
@media media_type and (condition) {
  /* CSS rules here */
}


media_type → like screen, print, speech

condition → like max-width: 768px, orientation: landscape

CSS rules → the styles you want to apply when the condition matches

 Example
        /* Default styles */
        body {
        font-size: 18px;
        background: white;
        }

        /* For small screens (like mobile) */
        @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
        body {
            font-size: 14px;
            background: lightblue;
        }
        }

        /* For tablets */
        @media screen and (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
        body {
            font-size: 16px;
            background: lightgreen;
        }
        }

        Why use Media Queries?
        To make websites responsive
        To change layout, fonts, colors, or images based on screen size
        To hide/show elements on different devices


Breakpoints are screen sizes at which you apply different CSS rules so the design looks good on all devices.
Example
/* Default styles for desktop */
body {
  background: lightgreen;
}

/* Breakpoint at 768px (tablet) */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background: lightblue; /* changes when screen is 768px or smaller */
  }
}

/* Breakpoint at 480px (mobile) */
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  body {
    background: pink; /* changes when screen is 480px or smaller */
  }
}

Here:

768px → a breakpoint for tablets
480px → a breakpoint for mobiles
When the screen size crosses these points, the design “breaks” into a new layout.

         Common Media Query Breakpoints

                   // Extra small devices (phones, portrait) 
                    @media (max-width: 480px) {
                    styles for very small phones 
                    }

                    //Small devices (mobile, landscape) 
                    @media (max-width: 600px) {
                    styles for most phones 
                    }

                    //Medium devices (tablets, portrait) 
                    @media (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 768px) {
                    /* styles for portrait tablets */
                    }

                     Large devices (tablets, landscape / small laptops) 
                    @media (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
                    /* styles for landscape tablets & small laptops */
                    }

                    Extra large devices (laptops, desktops) 
                    @media (min-width: 1025px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
                    /* styles for normal laptops */
                    }

                     XXL devices (large desktops, wide screens)
                    @media (min-width: 1201px) {
                    /* styles for big monitors */
                    }

            How to remember easily

                0-600px → Mobile 
                601-768px → Tablets (portrait) 
                769-1024px → Tablets (landscape) / small laptops 
                1025-1200px → Desktops 
                1201px+ → Large desktops / TVs
